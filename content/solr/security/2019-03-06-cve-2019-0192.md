Title: CVE-2019-0192: Deserialization of untrusted data via jmx.serviceUrl in Apache Solr
category: solr/security
cve: CVE-2019-0192

**Severity:** High

**Vendor:**  
The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**

* 5.0.0 to 5.5.5
* 6.0.0 to 6.6.5

**Description:**  
ConfigAPI allows to configure Solr's JMX server via an HTTP POST request.
By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage
of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the
Solr side.

**Mitigation:**  
Any of the following are enough to prevent this vulnerability:

* Upgrade to Apache Solr 7.0 or later.
* Disable the ConfigAPI if not in use, by running Solr with the system property “disable.configEdit=true”
* If upgrading or disabling the Config API are not viable options, apply patch in [1] and re-compile Solr.
* Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic is allowed to ingress/egress your hosts running Solr.
